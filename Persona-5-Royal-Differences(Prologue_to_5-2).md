# Introduction

## Purpose

I wanted to create a comprehensive list of every last change I could find between the old game and the new game both to help players discover things that they may have missed, and to give people making walkthroughs or optimal daily guides an outline that will save them some time when writing up their own material.

## Methodology and notes about this list

This list is intended to document changes on a semi-specific level. I am simply listing things that I notice while playing through the game. I am being pretty meticulous with my documentation, but this list is not designed to document every single minor detail (such as individual stat changes to weapons and items or arcana-type changes to personas, for example). I am noting whatever I can as I go along and looking things up to verify that they have been changed if I can find a video or wiki article on the old game. 
  
I also intend for this guide to be as spoiler-free as possible in regards to the story, so even though I am writing down all the new things I notice, I will leave information about cutscenes and story elements as vague as I can so as not to ruin the experience for anyone.

## About the author

I played Persona 5 and am currently playing through P5R on a PS4 Pro but have not tried the PS3 version of the game. I completed my first run and New Game+ back-to-back on 11/11/2019 and 1/12/2020 respectively, so the game is still fairly fresh on my mind. I spent ~200 hours on the base game, a good chunk of which was devoted to optimizing a perfect roster of personas for Joker in NG+. I have gotten the Platinum Trophy for Persona 5.

# Changes (Prologue to 5/2)

## **Technical**

### Graphics & Performance

* Most if not all of the textures and models in the game appear to have been updated, and look a lot cleaner now that the game is not limited to the PS3's comparatively low texture cache size.
* Less aliasing (read: "jagged edges") on in-game models and geometry (not sure if this is due to the PS4 Pro's  4k upscaling or an anti-aliasing post processing effect.)
* Far fewer loading screens/reduced loading times.

### Saves and PSN

* There appears to be some sort of an autosave function (indicated by a spinning combination dial with the text "SYSTEM DATA SAVING" on top), although the game does not explicitly point out any autosave functionality and I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere online. There does not seem to be a dedicated save slot for it when attempting to manually load a save.
* There is no longer a separate blue "network save" slot.
* You can now take screenshots and video clips up to late December (I haven't tested this yet myself as I haven't gotten that far), after which they are blocked.
* Most (but not all) of the achievements have been updated, and they generally seem to be much less completionistic than the previous game. There are no achievements for ranking up all confidants, getting all vending machine items, clearing all mementos requests, etc. You could probably complete all the achievements in a single playthrough as long as you're paying attention to getting them; I haven't seen any that require a NG+ run.

### Sound Effects & Music

* There seem to be quite a few more ambient sound effects that weren't in the base game (like clanking chains/cages in Kamoshida's palace), but I'm mostly playing with headphones now, so I could just be noticing them more.

## **Gameplay**

### Story & Cutscenes

* A number of characters that show up later in the game make brief cameos and show up in various places around Tokyo much earlier than they did in the base game.
* >!Kamoshida can now be seen walking around the school after 4/18 and can be talked to for some more verbal abuse.!<
* >!The prologue also has a new in-engine cutscene that introduces Kasumi Yoshizawa.!<
* >!On 4/12, there is a new interactive cutscene that introduces the protagonist to Kasumi for the first time during a subway ride to school.!<
* >!On 4/18, there is another interactive cutscene with Kasumi and Kawakami.!<

### Daily Life

* There are quite a few new side conversations with NPC's that hint at the new activities and areas added to Tokyo in P5R.
* All of the classroom questions seem to have been changed.
* Bad weather will improve the knowledge gained by studying in the library.
* The tutorial for studying in the library also mentions that you may overhear students talking about you, which will reduce knowledge gained but increase guts. In P5, the description indicated that studying despite the noise would raise guts, I do not know how this has actually been adjusted, if at all.
* "Speed Reader" is a new book available in the library that can reduce the number of times you need to read a book to finish it. It is checked out on 4/18 when you're first given time to do activities on your own, but I assume that it will probably be checked in on specific dates or after certain events occur.
* Triple Seven (the convenience store) now pays ¥3500+ instead of ¥2800+, making it now pay more than the flower shop (¥3200+) per shift.
* Rafflesia (the flower shop) now only offers afternoon shifts. Previously you could work there in the afternoons or evenings.
* Working at Triple Seven now also improves your Charm stat.
* Triple Seven now offers a rewards point program that gives extra points on any day of the month with a 7 in it. On these days, more customers will come to the shop, allowing you to earn more Charm points and money than usual.
* There is a new Sports Store in the underground mall that sells some new consumables, accessories, and (presumably) confidant gifts for Ryuji. This store replaces the record label shop.
* A few of the shops in the underground mall now sell male confidant gifts.
* The Shibuya Diner on central street has been renamed to "Bikkuri Boy" and is closed until May.
* The bathhouse in Yongen-Jaya is closed until an unspecified later date.
* The batting cages now offer different activities based on the time of day. At night, you can swing as much as you want, but there are no prizes. Hitting three home runs at night earns you a coupon for a free daytime session.
* You can now read books in the evenings at the counter at LeBlanc.
* Some books now have a prerequisite Knowledge level in order to read them. 
* You can use the cleaning tools in the restroom of LeBlanc to improve your Kindness stat during the evenings.
* You can now sit and reflect on the toilet in LeBlanc, which will give you hints as to how close you are to improving each of your social stats.
* Cleaning up the bookshelf in your room on 4/18 or later will reward you with a few new books to read.
* Cleaning out the rest of your room on 4/18 or later will also give you a CRT TV, although it does not include a tuner so you cannot receive TV blurbs from your room.
* The CRT TV is now replaced with a DVD player at the secondhand shop.
* I believe this was in the previous game, but there is now a tutorial that points out that you can solve crossword puzzles at the far table (near the restroom) at LeBlanc without causing time to progress.

### Palaces

* The prologue sequence at Sae Nijima's casino now has a tutorial sequence that shows the player how to use the grappling hook.

### Combat

* Guns now replenish all ammo after each fight, the rationale (according to Morgana) is that Shadows will be expecting you to come at them fully loaded. The gun tutorial fight in Kamoshida's palace now has a second encounter to show off this new change.
* _Take Over_ now plays during ambush attacks instead of _Last Surprise_. _Last Surprise_ will still play during normal encounters and enemy ambushes.

### Items & Equipment

* The stats and prices for most (if not all) equipment has been altered at Untouchable. In general, gun accuracy and damage seems to have gone down while prices have gone up (presumably due to the ammo replenishment change). The accessories that are initially available are completely different than in P5.
* Crafting infiltration tools during bad weather will now allow you to make an additional tool.
* The "Stealthanol" infiltration tool has been replaced by "Calming Aroma" which seems to have the same effect (lowers security level). 
* The "Element Set" infiltration tool has been broken down into it's four component items (Moltov Cocktail, Freeze Spray, Stun Gun, and Air Cannon)

### Personas & The Velvet Room

* There are some dialog choices in a few of the initial conversations with Igor that require Guts to be leveled a bit in order to say them. I do not recall if these were in the base game or not.

### Confidants

* Tae Takemi's voice actress has been changed from Kirsten Potter to Abby Trott (who also voices Annette in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of my favorite VA's in the game)
* Some of the confidant rank-up cutscenes have either had new dialog added, or have been overhauled completely.
* Some confidant abilities have been altered, replaced, or shuffled around to unlock at different ranks than before. 

### Dialog & UI

* Party members now cycle through three portrait angles (instead of just one in P5) with 2-3 expressions each. The general pattern is head down (sad, angry) head tilted up and back (surprised, happy) and then all of the normal portraits from P5. There don't seem to be any new portraits for non-party confidants or named characters (like Shiho)
* Some of the NPC's are now voiced, like the parcel deliveryman that directs you to Cafe Leblanc when you are attempting to find Sojiro Sakurai's house.
* The dialog indicators (i.e. "whisper whisper" "chatter" etc.) over NPC's that you can listen to or talk to will be grayed-out after interacting with them to let you know that you've already interacted with them.
* Many interactions with confidants that were previously text-only are now voiced.
* Phone conversations now show the portrait of the person you're talking to next to the text box.* The chat app on Joker's phone now has an animated background effect. (Falling flower petals right now, not sure if it changes as the seasons/weather changes yet)
* Shadows and other entities now have special effects on their dialog boxes when speaking.
* Transition animations when moving between areas have changed due to the reduced loading times. Some of them (like the subway animation) will also change depending on the time of day/weather.
* The glyphs for the Playstation button controls in the tutorial prompts are now colored and shaped like the actual button used instead of being a more generic red-colored character.
* Tutorial pop-ups now allow you to go back-and-forth between sections using the left and right buttons on the d-pad.
* There is now a new "Order Obtained" tab under the inventory interface that sorts items from newest to oldest.
* There is no longer an "Urgent" category of infiltration tools (as of 4/17). These have been grouped into the "Palace" category of tools. 
* Pressing the touch pad now does more than just showing what other players have done on the same day as you (though that is still an option). It can bring up Assist Commands, which allow you to view recommendations on which confidant you should spend time with, view suggestions for which activities to do, and quickly travel to the hideout with a single button press.
* There are now minimap icons for confidants.
* Confidant abilities that carry over from the previous game now have more descriptive text. (i.e. Ryuji's "Punk Talk" ability now specifies that it only works on _upbeat_-type shadows.)

### Miscellaneous QoL

* Aside from the infamous first walk to school, most interactions that involve going somewhere new or following another character will be more guided, preventing the player from getting lost (like when Ryuji shows you the way to the airsoft shop for the first time)

# Disclaimer

I have tried to document all of the changes that I have noticed from the base game, but there is a good chance that I have overlooked things and/or have noticed something "new" that was actually in the base game.  
 
Feel free to point out any errors in this post or contribute via the Github link, as this is intended to be a living document with frequent updates.
