## Purpose

I wanted to create a comprehensive list of every last change I could find between the old game and the new game both to help players discover things that they may have missed, and to give people making walkthroughs or optimal daily guides an outline that will save them some time when writing up their own material.

## Methodology and notes about this list

This list is intended to document changes on a semi-specific level. I am simply listing things that I notice while playing through the game. I am being pretty meticulous with my documentation, but this list is not designed to document every single minor detail (such as individual stat changes to weapons and items or arcana-type changes to personas, for example). I am noting whatever I can as I go along and looking things up to verify that they have been changed if I can find a video or wiki article on the old game. 
  
I also intend for this guide to be as spoiler-free as possible in regards to the story, so even though I am writing down all the new things I notice, I will leave information about cutscenes and story elements as vague as I can so as not to ruin the experience for anyone.

To keep things maintainable, I have broken up the list up into logical date spans from the last deadline of the previous palace to the deadline for the next palace; the first list covers the prologue to the deadline for Kamoshida's palace, the second from the day after Kamoshida's deadline to Madarame's deadline, and so on and so forth.

## About the author

I played Persona 5 and am currently playing through P5R on a PS4 Pro but have not tried the PS3 version of the game. I completed my first run and New Game+ back-to-back on 11/11/2019 and 1/12/2020 respectively, so the game is still fairly fresh on my mind. I spent ~250 hours on the base game, a good chunk of which was devoted to optimizing a perfect roster of personas for Joker in NG+. I have gotten the Platinum Trophy for Persona 5.

# Changes (5/3 to 6/5)
---

## ***Technical***

### Sound Effects & Music

* The driving sound effect that morgana makes when moving around while in bus form has been changed.

## ***Gameplay***

### Thieves Den

* You unlock the Thieves Den on 5/5 once you finish the follow-up story events after completing Kamoshida's palace.
* >!The Thieves Den introduces the player to Jose for the first time if they haven't already met him in Mementos.!<
* The Thieves Den is an in-game area that acts similar to a rewards gallery from other games that show off the player's accomplishments and let you view a lot of extra content from the game.
* Most of the extra content in the Thieves Den must be unlocked using a unique currency called "P Medals". P Medals can be earned by completing a variety of achievement-style tasks in your daily life, in the Velvet Room, in Mementos, and in Palaces.
* There is a variety of extra content included in the thieves den:
    * There is a vending machine that allows the player to purchase and display models of characters, personas, buildings, items, and a variety of other assets.
    * The player can change the background music that plays while wandering around the Thieves Den to any of the games songs. Songs cost anywhere in the range of 3-10 P Medals based on their popularity and length. 
    * The anime and in-game cutscenes, as well as the trailers and anime opening, can now be unlocked for viewing in exchange for P Medals
    * There is now an art gallery that showcases in-game art, concept art, and some of the art used in marketing and promotional materials.
    * There are tiles on the second floor of the Thieves Den that will allow you to change into unlocked outfits for Joker, or will allow you to change into other characters entirely while within the Thieves Den.
    * There is now a new card game called Tycoon that can be played to earn P Medals. P Medals are awarded based on the difficulty level (of Tycoon, not the overall difficulty) and performance during the match. There are also challenges that can be completed within Tycoon to earn bonus P Medals.

### Story & Cutscenes

* >!On 5/5, more of the VIP's from Shido's palace are now at the Wilton Hotel Buffet for you to eavesdrop on.!<
* >!Ryuji now sends a group message with a photo of the Phantom Thieves' celebration at the Wilton Hotel.!<
* >!There are more NPC conversations that hint at Madarame's appearance and the scandal about his art students.!<
* >!"What's bonkin'?"!<
* >!The new Councillor confidant, Dr. Takuto Maruki, is introduced on 5/13 during a school assembly.(I AM FERDINAND VON AEGIR)!<
* >!There is another brief cutscene on 5/13 involving the player, Maruki, and Kasumi.!<
* >!There is now a new cutscene on 5/24 of Ryuji and Dr. Maruki!<

### Daily Life

* From 5/6 and onward, you can no longer earn guts points for studying at the library, and will earn extra knowledge points instead.
* Hot Coffee has been replaced with Surprise Sando for the same price(Â¥700). It also still gives the same amount of guts. (Maybe this was to avoid association with GTA's Hot Coffee mod? I have no idea why they changed this.)
* Ore no Beko (the beef bowl shop) now has a special Yakiniku Day, which is a particularly busy day that can earn you bonus proficiency points if you manage to remember all the customers' orders.
* You will now also receive some Big Bang Burger consumables as an additional bonus for completing the Comet Burger (the first BBB challenge) 

### Palaces & Mementos

* Morgana can now dash while in bus form in Mementos.
* Shadows will now respawn while wandering around the same floor in Mementos.
* >!Jose is introduced on 5/7 right before heading out of Mementos. He informs you that he will trade you items and other perks in exchange for finding flowers in Mememntos. He also says that he will come up with some games for you to participate in in exchange for these bonuses as well.!<
* >!Jose also gives you a mysterious star item, that he claims can grant a wish. It is unclear at this point how exactly it can be used...!<
* Chests in palaces now look like the surrounding scenery in the palace, instead of using a generic model.


### Combat

### Items & Equipment

### Personas & The Velvet Room

* Persona traits are introduced upon officially entering Madarame's palace for the first time after 5/18. Traits are special bonus characteristics of individual personas that imbue the persona with a variety of effects.
* Traits can be inherited when fusion occurs, three traits can be selected; the trait of the first persona, the trait of the second persona, or the trait unique to the resulting persona.

### Confidants

* Mishima's confidant now requires you to complete Mementos requests in order to make progress towards his social link. 
* >!After the initial cutscene with Maruki on 5/13, you will gain him as the new Councillor confidant. You will also be railroaded into your first confidant rank cutscene with him on the same day. Based on the first bonus you get with him, I assume that his confidant perks will be related to nullifying status ailments, restoring SP, and granting buffs to the party.!<
* After completing the first rank of his social link, Yoshida's schedule is adjusted so that he only gives speeches on Sunday evenings.
* The personas (and the associated skills) required to advance the Strength confidant have been altered.
* Sojiro's confidant now requires you brew coffee at LeBlanc a certain number of times before being able to advance his social link past rank 2.

### Dialog & UI

* There are no longer empty lines of "--------" in selection menus to indicate hidden options that have not been unlocked yet.
* The camera angle has been adjusted for the Accessway hideout location.

### Miscellaneous QoL
