## Notes

 Played on a PS4 Pro, finished the base game and ng+ platinum trophy back-to-back on 11/11/2019 and 1/12/2020 respectively, previous game is still fairly fresh on my mind, spent ~200 hours on the base game, a good chunk of which was devoted to optimizing a perfect roster of personas for Joker in NG+.

# Changes



* Most if not all of the textures and models in the game appear to have been updated, and look a lot cleaner now that the game is not limited to the PS3's comparatively low texture cache size.
* Less aliasing (read: "jagged edges") on in-game models and geometry (not sure if this is due to the PS4 Pro's  4k upscaling or an anti-aliasing post processing effect.
* Far fewer loading times
* There appears to be some sort of an autosave function (indicated by a spinning combination dial) that I've only seen while navigating palaces, although the game does not explicitly point out any autosave functionality and I haven't seen it mentioned anywhere online.
* There is no longer a separate blue "network save" slot.
* You can now take screenshots and video clips up to late December (I haven't tested this yet myself as I haven't gotten that far), after which they are blocked to somehow prevent people from leaking spoilers, I guess?
* The achievements seem to be much less completionistic than the previous game. There are no achievements for ranking up all confidants, getting all vending machine items, clearing all mementos requests, etc. You could probably complete all the achievements in a single playthrough as long as you're paying attention to getting them.
* There seem to be quite a few more ambient sound effects that weren't in the base game, but I'm mostly playing with headphones now, so I could just be noticing them more.
* The glyphs for the Playstation button controls in the tutorial prompts are now colored and shaped like the actual button used instead of being a generic red-colored character.
* The prologue sequence at Sae Nijima's casino now has a tutorial sequence that shows the player how to use the grappling hook.
* The prologue also has a new in-engine cutscene that introduces Kazumi
* Party members now cycle through three portrait angles (instead of just one in P5) with 2-3 expressions each. The general pattern is head down (sad, angry) head tilted up and back (surprised, happy) and then all of the normal portraits from P5. There don't seem to be any new portraits for non-party confidants or named characters (like Shiho)
* Some of the NPC's are now voiced, like the parcel deliveryman that directs you to Cafe Leblanc when you are attempting to find Sojiro Sakurai's house.
* The dialog indicators (i.e. "whisper whisper" "chatter" etc.) over NPC's that you can listen to or talk to will be grayed-out after interacting with them to let you know that you've already interacted with them.
* Many interactions with all confidants that were previously text-only are now voiced.
* There are some dialog choices in a few of the initial conversations with Igor that require Guts to be leveled a bit in order to say them. I do not recall if these were in the base game or not.
* There is a new interactive cutscene within the first few days that introduces Kasumi during a subway ride to school.
* Guns now replenish all ammo after each fight, the rationale (according to Morgana) is that Shadows will be expecting you to come at them fully loaded. The gun tutorial fight now has a second encounter to show off this new change.
* Phone conversations now show the portrait of the person you're talking to next to the text box.
* The chat app on Joker's phone now has an animated background effect. (Falling flower petals right now, not sure if it changes as the seasons/weather changes yet)
* Transition animations when moving between areas have changed due to the reduced loading times. Some of them (like the subway animation) will also change depending on the time of day/weather.
* Shadows and other entities now have special effects on their dialog boxes when speaking.
* Tae Takemi's voice actress has been changed from Kirsten Potter to Abby Trott (who also voices Annette in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, one of my favorite VA's in the game)
* There are quite a few new side conversations with NPC's that hint at the new activities and areas added to Tokyo in P5R.
* Aside from the infamous first walk to school, most interactions that involve going somewhere new or following another character will be more guided, preventing the player from getting lost (like when Ryuji shows you the way to the airsoft shop for the first time)
* The stats and prices for most (if not all) equipment has been altered at Untouchable. In general, gun accuracy and damage seems to have gone down while prices have gone up (presumably due to the ammo replenishment change). The accessories that are initially available are completely different than in P5.
* Tutorial pop-ups now allow you to go back-and-forth between sections using the left and right buttons on the d-pad. 
* There is now a new "Order Obtained" tab under the items interface that sorts items from newest to oldest.
* Crafting infiltration tools during bad weather will now allow you to make an additional tool.
* There is no longer an "Urgent" category of infiltration tools (as of 4/17). These have been grouped into the "Palace" category of tools. 
* The "Stealthanol" infiltration tool has been replaced by "Calming Aroma" which seems to have the same effect (lowers security level). 
* The "Element Set" infiltration tool has been broken down into it's four component items (Moltov Cocktail, Freeze Spray, Stun Gun, and Air Cannon)
* On 4/18, there is another interactive cutscene with Kazumi and Kawakami.
* Pressing the touch pad now does more than just showing what other players have done on the same day as you (though that is still an option). It can bring up Assist Commands, which allow you to view suggestions for which confidant you should spend time with, view suggestions for activities to do, and quickly travel to the hideout with a single button press.
* "Speed Reader" is a new book available in the library that can reduce the number of times you need to read a book to finish it. It is checked out on 4/18 when you're first given time to do activities on your own, but I assume that it will probably be checked in on specific dates or after certain events occur.
* Bad weather will improve the knowledge gained by studying in the library.
* The tutorial for studying in the library also mentions that you may overhear students talking about you, which will reduce knowledge gained but increase guts. In P5, the description indicated that studying despite the noise would raise guts, I do not know how this has actually been adjusted, if at all.
* Job listings have been adjusted for the new afternoon/evening/night schedule, and the specific social stat requirements are also included by each job as well.
* Triple Seven (the convenience store) now pays ¥3500+ instead of ¥2800+, making it now pay more than the flower shop (¥3200+) per shift.
* Working at Triple Seven now also improves your charm stat.
* There is a new Sports Store in the underground mall that sells some new consumables, accessories, and (presumably) confidant gifts for Ryuji. This store replaces the record label shop.
* A few of the shops now sell male confidant gifts.
* The Shibuya Diner on central street has been renamed to "Bikkuri Boy" and is closed until May.
* The bathhouse in Yongen-Jaya is closed until an unspecified later date.
* The batting cages now offer different activities based on the time of day. At night, you can swing as much as you want, but there are no prizes. Hitting three home runs at night earns you a coupon for a free daytime session.

# Disclaimer

I have tried to document all of the changes that I have noticed from the base game, but there is a good chance that I have overlooked things and/or have noticed something "new" that was actually in the base game.  
 
Feel free to point out any errors in this post as it is intended to be a living document with frequent updates made
