## Purpose

I wanted to create a comprehensive list of every last change I could find between the old game and the new game both to help players discover things that they may have missed, and to give people making walkthroughs or optimal daily guides an outline that will save them some time when writing up their own material.

## Methodology and notes about this list

This list is intended to document changes on a semi-specific level. I am simply listing things that I notice while playing through the game. I am being pretty meticulous with my documentation, but this list is not designed to document every single minor detail (such as individual stat changes to weapons and items or arcana-type changes to personas, for example). I am noting whatever I can as I go along and looking things up to verify that they have been changed if I can find a video or wiki article on the old game. 
  
I also intend for this guide to be as spoiler-free as possible in regards to the story, so even though I am writing down all the new things I notice, I will leave information about cutscenes and story elements as vague as I can so as not to ruin the experience for anyone.
However, I will mention differences from the base game, so details about palaces/palace owners/characters may be included without spoiler tags. If you have not played Persona 5 at all before, I highly recommend playing through either P5 or P5R at least once before reading these lists.

To keep things maintainable, I have broken up the list up into logical date spans from the last deadline of the previous palace to the deadline for the next palace; the first list covers the prologue to the deadline for Kamoshida's palace, the second from the day after Kamoshida's deadline to Madarame's deadline, and so on and so forth.

## About the author

I played Persona 5 and am currently playing through P5R on a PS4 Pro but have not tried the PS3 version of the game. I completed my first run and New Game+ back-to-back on 11/11/2019 and 1/12/2020 respectively, so the game is still fairly fresh on my mind. I spent ~250 hours on the base game, a good chunk of which was devoted to optimizing a perfect roster of personas for Joker in NG+. I have gotten the Platinum Trophy for Persona 5.

# Changes (Prologue to 5/2)
---

## ***Technical***

### Graphics & Performance

* The appearance and animations of some of the existing personas have been changed.
* The visibility has been improved in some areas of Mementos by changing the colors and lighting.


## ***Gameplay***

### Story & Cutscenes

* >!There is a new cutscene with Kasumi on 6/6.!<
* >!Ann Takamaki now sends a group photo of your hotpot party with Yusuke on 6/11!<
* There is now a special cutscene anytime a pair of party members learn a new Showtime finisher.
* There is an additional cutscene with Lala-chan after unlocking Ohya's social link.

### Daily Life

* >!You can now spend time with Caroline and Justine in the real world. In exchange for taking them on these outings, you can earn skill cards at the end. You will also potentially earn social link points, but that is irrelevant since the Strength confidant rank is tied to the completion of penal labors.!<
* There are now class questions directed towards Ann Takamaki rather than Joker that now grant you points towards her social link, as well as giving you a point towards your knowledge stat.
* Mran Mran (the furniture/general store) in Shinjuku now sells gifts for males.

### Palaces & Mementos

* Some of the new Mementos request targets can now be affected by the weather.
* Some of the new request targets in Mementos now have to be negotiated with in order to change their heart. 
* The new request targets now reward the player with unique items and accessories related to the theme of the request.
* Once you expand Mementos past the Path of Qimranut (the first area), Jose appears and introduces a number of new features to Mementos.
  * Stamps
    * As you explore mementos, you will discover Stamp Pedestals. Each pedestal contains one stamp, and turning in stamps with Jose will reward you with points.
    * The points earned from stamps can be used to change the cognition of mementos. By changing the cognition of the environment, you can improve the amount of money, experience, and items you receive within Mementos.
    * Points can be delegated to enhance each of these improvements much like a skill tree. You can use flowers to reset these points and reallocate them. The flower cost increases as the amount of reallocated points increases.
  * Flowers
    * Flowers are a type of currency that can be traded with Jose for a variety of rare items, most notably Black items/Blank Cards used for electric chair executions and an additional Will Seed, which can be purchased in case you missed one in a palace.
    * As mentioned above, flowers can also be spent to reallocate points spent on altering the cognition of Mementos.
    * Jose's will add new items to the flower shop as you unlock new paths in Mementos.
* You can now encounter deviations in Mementos. These deviated floors can either aid or harm your investigation of Mementos, and will have a variety of effects; some good, some bad.
* There are now breakable walls in mementos (similar to bomb-able walls in *Zelda*, for example) that usually have hidden chests, floating items, treasure shadows, or stamp podiums behind them. The walls are more obvious when using Third Eye.
* The Reaper is no longer affected by despair.
* While I want to avoid getting into too much detail about confidant ability changes, Ryuji's *Insta-Kill* ability is worth mentioning, specifically because of the new implications it has for grinding in Mementos. *Insta-Kill* now grants you the money, items, and XP that you would have earned from defeating a weak shadow without needing to enter combat, rather than just killing the enemy. Combined with the new shadow respawn mechanics and the stamp bonuses granted by Jose, farming for money, rare crafting materials, and experience is now much, much easier and faster than before. Do note that in order to trigger it, you must now sprint into enemies and attack them to trigger the insta-kill.
* Kaneshiro's palace now starts at a 40% security level on first infiltration.
* Watchdog-type shadows are introduced slightly earlier in Kaneshiro's palace in order to also introduce the new Showtime finisher mechanic. 
* In Kaneshiro's palace, if you are standing in a security cameras view when finishing a battle, you will no longer raise the security level.
* The Kaneshiro fight jumps immediately to the piggytron phase instead of fighting Kaneshiro directly. The boss fight has been modified to include an additional phase *after* defeating Kaneshiro's Piggytron form.

### Combat

* Showtime finishers are introduced the first time you infiltrate Kaneshiro's palace after 6/20.
  * Showtime finishers occur semi-randomly. They are more likely to occur when you Baton Pass to Joker, or to another member who is low on health. They can also happen when an enemy is near defeat.
  * Showtime finishers are initially only available for Ann and Morgana, but more can be unlocked as the story progresses.
  * Showtime finishers can be used even with reserve members, so you don't need to worry about having compatible members in your active party.
* Sleuthing Instinct is unlocked during the first infiltration to Kaneshiro's Palace.
  * Sleuthing Instinct randomly fires off at the start of battle for new personas that are not yet in the compendium. It will reveal an enemy affinity at random so that you are not required to test out every type of damage on a shadow to learn it's weakness. 
* Status ailments inflicted on enemies only last for one turn rather than two. This means that the previous confuse-based money farming method, while still possible, is much less effective. Ryuji's new Insta-Kill bonus, however, makes up for this quite nicely as there is much less setup involved.

### Items & Equipment

* *Cinema Treasures* at the Shinjuku bookstore has been renamed to *The Craft of Cinema*. The effect now extends to DVD's as well as movies watched in the theater.
*  *Learn Pro Darts* is a new book at the Shinjuku bookstore that allows you to use Third Eye to slow down time when playing darts at the Penguin Sniper Bar.
*  *ABC's of Crafting* is a new book at the Shinjuku bookstore that increases the number of infiltration tools you can make in a single sitting.
*  *Speed Reader* is now available in the school library as early as 7/1. This allows the player to boost their reading efficiency much earlier than in the base game, as *Speed Reader* was locked behind buying and reading all of the 3-sitting books at Jinbocho (Book Town).
*  Jose can now upgrade the accessories you get from Will Seeds in palaces (Crystal of Lust, Crystal of Vanity, etc.) into more powerful versions of themselves.
*  Equipment and Skill cards gained from electric chair executions during a Fusion Alarm will create more powerful versions of said items.

### Personas & The Velvet Room

* After infiltrating Kaneshiro's palace for the first time after 6/20, the new Fusion Alarm system will be introduced before you leave the palace.
  * Fusion alarms occur at random after winning battles in the metaverse. They can also be triggered manually through one of Chihaya's new fortune readings.
  * During Fusion Alarms, fusions will cause the resulting persona to gain more stat increases, inherit different skills, and increase the maximum number of skills that can be inherited by the resulting persona (making skill grinding much easier)
  * Using the Guillotine, Electric Chair, or the same execution method multiple times in a row will cause an accident.
  * If you use a persona created during an alarm as the material in another execution during the alarm, the chance of an accident is higher, but stat gains from the resulting persona may be increased even further.
  * You will be forced to leave the velvet room after an accident occurs during an alarm.
  * The alarm will also end if you leave after performing a fusion.
  * You can end the fusion alarm early if you do not wish to risk an accident by speaking to Justine.
* While I am not going into detail on most of the confidant ability changes in the game, I did want to mention that the Strength confidant bonus *Special Treatment* has shifted to rank 5 down from rank 10. This means that you can create high level personas (assuming you have the cash) significantly earlier than before, as previously you would need to reach at least level 51 in order to fuse a Seth with High Counter. This now means that, assuming you have enough money, you can rush the strength confidant to completion as soon as you can make a Setanta with Rakukaja (level 25).

### Confidants

* >!Kasumi now hangs out in Kichijoji after unlocking her social link.!<
* >!Aside from the initial interaction with him at the TV station, Akechi's social link has been completely overhauled. You can now hang out with him in Kichijoji, he usually hangs out around the Penguin Sniper bar.!<
  * >!Akechi's social link bonuses seem to revolve around exposing and exploiting enemy weaknesses and affinities.!<

### Dialog & UI

* Object models related to activities that benefit from weather effects (like rain) will glow blue when using Third Eye. For example, on rainy days, the door to the bathouse will glow when viewed with Third Eye.
* You can now view which party members have showtime finishers with each other in the party stats menu.
* Extremely weak shadows will now glow green when using Third Eye. This is an additional fourth category instead of replacing the blue glow on weak enemies.

I have tried to document all of the changes that I have noticed from the base game, but there is a good chance that I have overlooked things and/or have noticed something "new" that was actually in the base game.

Feel free to point out any errors in this post or contribute via the Github link, as this is intended to be a living document with frequent updates.
