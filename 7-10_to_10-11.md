# Notice

Due to the lack of much new content in Royal introduced after Kaneshiro's Arc, I will be combining the lists for Futaba/Okumura and Sae/Shido's arc into one list for each pair of palaces. The list structure will return to normal once reaching the third semester, as there will likely be a plethora of new content to accompany it.


# Introduction
---

## Purpose

I wanted to create a comprehensive list of every last change I could find between the old game and the new game both to help players discover things that they may have missed, and to give people making walkthroughs or optimal daily guides an outline that will save them some time when writing up their own material.

## Methodology and notes about this list

This list is intended to document changes on a semi-specific level. I am simply listing things that I notice while playing through the game. I am being pretty meticulous with my documentation, but this list is not designed to document every single minor detail (such as individual stat changes to weapons and items or arcana-type changes to personas, for example). I am noting whatever I can as I go along and looking things up to verify that they have been changed if I can find a video or wiki article on the old game. 
  
I also intend for this guide to be as spoiler-free as possible in regards to the story, so even though I am writing down all the new things I notice, I will leave information about cutscenes and story elements as vague as I can so as not to ruin the experience for anyone. However, I will mention differences from the base game, so details about palaces/palace owners/characters may be included without spoiler tags. If you have not played Persona 5 at all before, I highly recommend playing through either P5 or P5R at least once before reading these lists.

~~To keep things maintainable, I have broken up the list up into logical date spans from the last deadline of the previous palace to the deadline for the next palace; the first list covers the prologue to the deadline for Kamoshida's palace, the second from the day after Kamoshida's deadline to Madarame's deadline, and so on and so forth.~~ [SEE NOTICE](#notice)
## About the author

I played Persona 5 and am currently playing through P5R on a PS4 Pro but have not tried the PS3 version of the game. I completed my first run and New Game+ back-to-back on 11/11/2019 and 1/12/2020 respectively, so the game is still fairly fresh on my mind. I spent ~250 hours on the base game, a good chunk of which was devoted to optimizing a perfect roster of personas for Joker in NG+. I have gotten the Platinum Trophy for Persona 5.

### Daily Life

* When spending a day with one of your party members, you now have the option to partake in multiple different activities with them during the evening rather than just sharing coffee or curry.
* There is a new aquarium hangout spot that is unlocked on 7/28 if you commit to spending the day with Akechi.
* The Flower Shop in the underground mall now has Happy Flower Days on Wednesdays and Saturdays that offer additional pay if you correctly select the right flowers for the customers.
* You can now work at Crossroads on Sunday evenings for extra pay.
* The church in Kanda now grants rewards if you donate money on Sundays.
* The Temple in Kichijoji is open during the daytime. It allows you to increase your maximum SP by meditating.
* After reaching rank 4 of Akechi's social link, you will be introduced to the Jazz Club.
  * The Jazz Club allows you to strengthen your *confidants'* Personas, similar to how the Gym or chair in your room can be used to strengthen your own.
  * The effect that the Jazz Club has changes depending on the day of the week.
  * Visiting the Jazz Club on a day when a live singer performs will coincide with a special cocktail being served. The effects of the cocktail are doubled on weekdays.
* You can now access the arcade toys in Akihabara a bit earlier on 9/1.
* The maid café in Akihabara now has a stamp card program. Collecting stamps at the maid cafe will grant rewards after collecting a certain number of them.
  * You can receive more stamps from the maid café on Saturdays.


### Palaces & Mementos

* Kasumi's first few confidant ranks now teach you how to avoid being surrounded if an enemy attacks you first, and how to ambush enemies further away using the grappling hook.
* There is now a brief shot in Futaba's palace that indicates that taking the gemstones from the anubis statues causes shadows to spawn. 
* Futabas palace now has a few additional safe rooms.
* The boss fight in Futaba's palace now has some additional dialog, but is mostly unchanged.
* Futabas Mementos Scan animation is now sped up after it triggers the first time.
* Yusuke's *Live Painting* ability can now be used while inside safe rooms in a a palace.
* >!The Okumura boss fight is now much harder as Okumura gets more turns to perform actions. There is also a new phase with a robot Haru that extends the time-limited fight further. Be prepared with a strong persona before attempting this fight.!<

### Combat

* In addition to being able to ambush enemies from further away, Kasumi's *Chaînés Hook* confidant ability will cause ambushed enemies to begin the fight in a Dizzy, Confused, or Feared state.
* Ann and Yusuke unlock a new Showtime Finisher when visiting the hideout on or after 9/18.
* Futaba now has a special finisher that can trigger during an All-out-attack.
* To balance with the new ammo system, Shinya's *Down Shot* confidant ability can now only be used a specific number of times per infiltration, rather than simply consuming all ammo.

### Items & Equipment

* The equipment and skill cards that can be earned via the electric chair execution has been changed for almost every persona. Additionally, there are many "Powered-up" versions ending with an "R" that can be had while using the electric chair during a Fusion Alarm.
* Gun customization through Iwai's social link has been significantly changed. You can now modify multiple parts, rather than just upgrading a base weapon.
  * The higher your confidant rank with Iwai, the more parts per gun you can change out.
  * *ANY* gun can now be customized.
* Akiba Electronics (the old machine-parts store) now sells Red Phosphorus, which was a very rare and hard-to-find material in the base game. It is used to craft the eternal lockpick and some other powerful infiltration tools.
* Tokobushiya (the otaku goods shop) and Akindo (the electronics superstore) in Akihabara now sells male gifts.
* Some of the items received from the man near the capsule toy machines in Akihabara have been changed. You can still get model guns from trading the Mossy Mothman figurine with him, however.
* The second-hand shop in Yongen-Jaya now occasionally sells Black Kotaganas.
* At rank 7, Yusuke unlocks *Live Painting*, which allows him to use Card Duplication and Card Creation on the spot, without taking any time. This is extremely useful for building personas without needing to savescum for abilities using the gallows method.
* Some guns can inflict status ailments at the cost of having a smaller ammo pool.

### Personas & The Velvet Room

* The gallows are now unlocked later on 8/1 by visiting the velvet room. This has been changed from 6/5 after beating Madarame's palace.
* Another notable new confidant ability is Yusuke's *Card Creation*, which unlocks at rank 5 of his social link. It allows Yusuke to create any skill card that he has copied before *without* needing the original skill card first. As such, it would be a good idea to make duplicates of any really useful or rare skills at least once, so that you can create them again later if you need to for a specific persona (like Ali Dance, Almighty Amp/Boost, Magical Ability, etc.)

### Confidants

* >!Akechi will ask to hangout with you on 7/28. If you commit, you will earn social link points with both him and Ohya.!<
* >!The "I am thou, thou art I..." line that plays when finishing a confidant's social link is significantly different when ranking up Kasumi to rank 5.!<
* Hifumi now asks you to commit to an outing to Akihabara on 9/22.

### Dialog & UI

* There is a new interface to handle gun customization at Untouchable.
* There is a new UI element to view the workbench decorations when interacting with room decorations.

I have tried to document all of the changes that I have noticed from the base game, but there is a good chance that I have overlooked things and/or have noticed something "new" that was actually in the base game.

Feel free to point out any errors in this post or contribute via the Github link, as this is intended to be a living document with frequent updates.
